					CAMBRIDGE&#8218 Mass. &#9866 One night late in 1979&#8218 an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth&#8218 with a new son and a year&#8217s appointment at Stanford&#8218 stayed up late with his notebook and equations&#8218 venturing far beyond the world of known physics.

					He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a repulsive force&#8218 causing the universe to swell faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant.
					
					If true&#8218 the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged&#8218 warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were not missing&#8218 but would be diluted beyond detection&#8218 like spit in the ocean.
					
					&#8220SPECTACULAR REALIZATION&#8218&#8221 Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a double box around it.
			</p>
			<h4>&#8216As Big as It Gets&#8217</h4>
			<p class="article-body">
					In our own universe&#8218 it would serve as a window into the forces operating at energies forever beyond the reach of particle accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself. Dr. Kovac&#8217s ripples would be the first direct observation of gravitational waves&#8218 which&#8218 according to Einstein&#8217s theory of general relativity&#8218 should ruffle space-time.

					Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University&#8218 an early-universe expert who was not part of the team&#8218 said&#8218 &#8220This is huge&#8218 as big as it gets.&#8221
					
					He continued&#8218 &#8220This is a signal from the very earliest universe&#8218 sending a telegram encoded in gravitational waves.&#8221
					
					The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of microwave radiation that permeates space and preserves a picture of the universe when it was 380&#8218 000 years old and as hot as the surface of the sun.

					Confused&#8218 Dr. Linde called out to his wife&#8218 asking if she had ordered anything.

					&#8220And then I told him that in the beginning we thought that this was a delivery but we did not think that we ordered anything&#8218 but I simply forgot that actually I did order it&#8218 30 years ago&#8218&#8221 Dr. Linde wrote in an email.
					
					Calling from Bonaire&#8218 the Dutch Caribbean island&#8218 Dr. Linde said he was still hyperventilating. &#8220Having news like this is the best way of spoiling a vacation&#8218&#8221 he said.
					
					By last weekend&#8218 as social media was buzzing with rumors that inflation had been seen and news spread&#8218 astrophysicists responded with a mixture of jubilation and caution.
					
					Max Tegmark&#8218 a cosmologist at M.I.T.&#8218 wrote in an email&#8218 &#8220I think that if this stays true&#8218 it will go down as one of the greatest discoveries in the history of science.&#8221
					
					John E. Carlstrom of the University of Chicago&#8218 Dr. Kovac&#8217s mentor and head of a competing project called the South Pole Telescope&#8218 pronounced himself deeply impressed. &#8220I think the results are beautiful and very convincing&#8218&#8221 he said.

					Spirals in the Sky
			</h4>
			<p class="article-body">
					Gravity waves are the latest and deepest secret yet pried out of the cosmic microwaves&#8218 which were discovered accidentally by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson at Bell Labs 50 years ago. They won the Nobel Prize.

					Dr. Kovac has spent his career trying to read the secrets of these waves. He is one of four leaders of Bicep&#8218 which has operated a series of increasingly sensitive radio telescopes at the South Pole&#8218 where the thin&#8218 dry air creates ideal observing conditions. The others are Clement Pryke of the University of Minnesota&#8218 Jamie Bock of the California Institute of Technology and Dr. Kuo of Stanford.
					
					&#8220The South Pole is the closest you can get to space and still be on the ground&#8218&#8221 Dr. Kovac said. He has been there 23 times&#8218 he said&#8218 wintering over in 1994. &#8220I&#8217ve been hooked ever since&#8218&#8221 he said.

			<p class="article-body">
					In 2002&#8218 he was part of a team that discovered that the microwave radiation was polarized&#8218 meaning the light waves had a slight preference to vibrate in one direction rather than another.

					This was a step toward the ultimate goal of detecting the gravitational waves from inflation. Such waves&#8218 squeezing space in one direction and stretching it in another as they go by&#8218 would twist the direction of polarization of the microwaves&#8218 theorists said. As a result&#8218 maps of the polarization in the sky should have little arrows going in spirals.
					
					Detecting those spirals required measuring infinitesimally small differences in the temperature of the microwaves. The group&#8217s telescope&#8218 Bicep2&#8218 is basically a giant superconducting thermometer.
					
					&#8220We had no expectations what we would see&#8218&#8221 Dr. Kovac said.
					
					The strength of the signal surprised the researchers&#8218 and they spent a year burning up time on a Harvard supercomputer&#8218 making sure they had things right and worrying that competitors might beat them to the breakthrough.
			</p>
					<h4>A Special Time</h4>
			<p class="article-body">
					The data traced the onset of inflation to a time that physicists like Dr. Guth&#8218 staying up late in his Palo Alto house 35 years ago&#8218 suspected was a special break point in the evolution of the universe.
					
					Physicists recognize four forces at work in the world today: gravity&#8218 electromagnetism&#8218 and strong and weak nuclear forces. But they have long suspected that those are simply different manifestations of a single unified force that ruled the universe in its earliest&#8218 hottest moments.
					
					As the universe cooled&#8218 according to this theory&#8218 there was a fall from grace&#8218 like some old folk mythology of gods or brothers falling out with each other. The laws of physics evolved&#8218 with one force after another splitting away.
					
					That was where Dr. Guth came in.
